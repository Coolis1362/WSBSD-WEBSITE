     WSBSD RSS News Channel 1 delivers structured daily transmissions from the WSBSD project. This channel shares version updates, delays, announcements, and system status logsâ€”formatted like mission briefings.

     Each broadcast includes a status signature (e.g. SFTD, OPERATIONAL, DFTD) to simulate the WSBSD system's state throughout the cycle. Channel 1 is the flagship node in the WSBSD RSS network.
